/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding occurs when a function containing the `this` keyword was invoked on the global
*    object without any binding. With this, the `this` keyword refers to the global object which is 
*    window object in this case of the DOM.
* 2. Implicit binding is when the function containing the `this` keyword was invoked on the containing
*    object using the dot notation. The `this` keyword refers back to the object.
* 3. New Binding occurs when the `new` keyword is used to instatiate a new instance of the object containing the 
*    `this` keyword. In this case, the `this` keyword refers to the newly created object.
* 4. Explicit Binding occurs when a function is specifically binded to an object using .apply(), .call() or .bind()
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
